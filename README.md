# flexible-plate-capacitance-calculation
This models the capacitance of a solid plate below a flexible plate attached to a drum.

The shape of the drum membrane changes with time. This model uses the u_01 mode of vibration (which I learned about at the "Vibrations of a circular membrane" Wikipedia page) to calculate the potential extreme values of capacitance.
